# 💵 Budget Buddy

**Budget Buddy** is a command-line tool to help you track your income and expenses in real time. It runs entirely in your terminal and stores your data locally in a JSON file.

This is a foundational project built in Python to improve my skills in:
- File input/output
- CLI interaction
- Structuring a simple, expandable application

It’s designed to grow in complexity as I learn more.

## 🚀 Features

- Add income and expenses with descriptions
- View current totals (income, expenses, net)
